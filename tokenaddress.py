This application is configured to process your specific report format.

**How to use:**
1.  **Upload your report** (Excel file). The app will automatically read the **first tab**.
2.  The app will assume tickers are in **Column A**.
3.  **Provide the base API URL.** The app will append each ticker to this URL to find its address.
4.  Click the **'Find Addresses'** button to see the results. The new addresses will be in a column named `token address`.
